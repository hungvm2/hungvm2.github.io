```python

This note is spent to introduce briefly about myself:
My name's HÆ°ng, currently live and work in Hanoi.
I graduated from Hanoi University of Transport and Communications with Road & Bridge Engineering Degree.
After few years working as a Civil Engineer, I decided to change the career path to become a Software Engineer.
I love engineering in general, especially software & machine learning then it will be the main topic of this blog. Other topics will be about life, social problems and my own opinions, etc..
Thanks for reading ^^
